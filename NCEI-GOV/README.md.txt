# U.S. Weather and Climate Disasters Dataset

## Overview

The U.S. Weather and Climate Disasters Dataset provides information on significant weather and climate-related disasters in the United States since 1980. This dataset includes details on the number of events, associated costs, and fatalities caused by these disasters. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the economic and societal impacts of severe weather events.

### Dataset Statistics

- Total Events (1980-present): 371
- Average Events Per Year: 8.4
- Total Cost (1980-present): $2,616.1 billion
- Average Annual Cost: $59.5 billion
- Total Deaths (1980-present): 16,111
- Average Annual Deaths: 366

### Last Year (2022)

In 2022, there were 18 weather and climate disasters in the United States, ranking 5th in terms of the number of events. These disasters resulted in a total cost of $177.6 billion, ranking 3rd in terms of cost, and 474 fatalities, ranking 8th in terms of deaths.

## 2023 in Progress

As of September 11, 2023, there have been 23 confirmed weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each in the United States. These events include flooding, severe storms, tropical cyclones, wildfires, and winter storms. These events have resulted in 253 deaths and significant economic impacts on affected areas.

## Potential Billion-Dollar Events

Here are some events in 2023 where damage costs potentially exceed $1 billion:

- **Tropical Storm Hilary (August 2023):** This storm caused record-breaking rainfall and flooding in southern California.
- **Southern and Midwest Drought (Spring-Fall 2023):** Drought conditions impacted several Midwestern states, affecting agriculture and livestock.

### Data Sources and Methodology

The dataset is maintained by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), which monitors and assesses climate events in the U.S. and globally. NCEI uses a rigorous methodology to develop billion-dollar disaster assessments, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the data.
